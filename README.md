## Description

- Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). My task is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
WHEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees

```

## Installation

- Prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm should be installed on your system.
- MySQL should be installed on your system.

##

- Step 1: Clone the Repository

```md
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to install the application.
Clone the repository by running the command: git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git.
Navigate to the cloned directory using the command: cd repository-name.
```

##

- Step 2: Install Dependencies

```md
In the terminal, run the command: npm install.
This will install all the dependencies required for the application to run.
```

##

- Step 3: Set up the Database

```md
Create a new database in MySQL using the command: CREATE DATABASE database-name;.
Open the schema.sql file located in the db folder of the application.
Copy and paste the contents of the file into a new query in MySQL Workbench and run it.
This will create the necessary tables for the application.
```

##

- Step 4: Configure the Application

- In the db folder, create a new file named .env.
- Open the file and add the following lines:

```md
DB_USER= 'your-mysql-username'
DB_PASSWORD= 'your-mysql-password'
DB_NAME= 'database-name'
```

```md
Replace 'your-mysql-username' and 'your-mysql-password' with your MySQL username and password, respectively.
Replace 'database-name' with the name of the database you created in step 3.
```

##

- Step 5: Start the Application

```md
In the terminal, run the command: npm start.
This will start the application and you should see the message "Server running on port 3001".
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3001 to use the application.
```
